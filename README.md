## üöÄ Side Project: CacheWarp (WIP)

**CacheWarp** is my pet project‚Äîa *FastAPI* and *Redis*-powered caching middleware to make APIs snappier. It‚Äôs where I‚Äôm sharpening my skills and having fun:  
- **Two-Tier Caching:** In-memory plus Redis for speed  
- **Smart TTLs:** Cache that stays fresh on its own  
- **No Overload:** Stops duplicate requests from piling up  
- **Metrics:** *Prometheus* and *Grafana* to keep tabs on performance
