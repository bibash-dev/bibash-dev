## 🚀 Side Project: CacheWarp (Work in Progress)

**CacheWarp**: Just playing around with making APIs faster! It's a FastAPI middleware that uses caching with Redis to try and speed things up. I'm still learning how to make it reliable and write good code.

Here's what I've got so far:

✅ **Two-Layer Caching:** Uses in-memory (like a quick scratchpad) for fast access and Redis (like a more permanent storage) to keep things around longer.
✅ **Smart Time Limits:** The cache tries to figure out how long to keep stuff based on how busy things are.
✅ **Keeping Things in Check:** It tries to stop getting too many of the same requests at once.
✨ **Watching How Things Go:** I'm trying to use Prometheus to see what's happening and Grafana to make some charts about it. Still figuring this part out!
