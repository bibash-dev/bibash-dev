### Backend Engineer | Microservices Enthusiast

Hey, I'm Bibash, a backend engineer hooked on building fast, scalable systems. I love tinkering with microservices, cloud-native tech, and performance tweaks, aiming to write code that solves problems today and scales for tomorrow while learning from every challenge.

## 🚀 Side Project: CacheWarp (Work in Progress)

**CacheWarp**: My deep dive into API acceleration. This FastAPI middleware blends in-memory agility with Redis durability, all while I hone the art of robust and elegant code.

Here's what makes it tick:

✅ **Hybrid Caching Powerhouse:** Blazing-fast in-memory (L1) for immediate wins, backed by persistent Redis (L2) for resilience.
✅ **Intelligent TTLs:** Dynamic cache lifetimes that intelligently adapt to varying traffic demands.
✅ **Request Deduplication:** Built-in rate limiting to efficiently manage redundant incoming requests.
✨ **Enhanced Observability:** Leveraging OpenTelemetry for detailed tracing and insightful Grafana dashboards.
